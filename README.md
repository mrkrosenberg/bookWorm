# Bookworm Reading List

Bookworm Reading List is an interactive web app that allows users to create to-read lists and keep track of books they have 
an interest in. I approached this project with very little experience in Laravel and never build a full stack app using php.
The Laravel framework was relatively simple to wrap my head around, yet powerful enough to do what I had envisioned.


## Tech

  - Laravel 5
  - Blade templating
  - Javascript
  - Sass

  - set up local development environment:
    - Laravel docs are comprehensive and very well laid out
    - Valet makes setting up a single entry point for all your projects simple and quick
      - https://laravel.com/docs/5.6/installation

## Not Done Yet! - Features for the future

    - I would to implement a search function to do text searches through the reading list
    - I would also like to add authentication (laravel makes this really simple) to this app and allow
    users to save their own private reading lists
    - Implementing a 3rd party api to search a database for books would make this app much more useful
    - Adding a calendar-type function where users could add in timeframes that they want to complete a book in.
    That way users could not only save books to a reading list, but also stay on track and record progress as they
    work their way through the ever-expanding list
