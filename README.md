# Bookworm Reading List

Bookworm Reading List is an interactive web app that allows users to create to-read lists and keep track of books they have 
an interest in. I approached this project with very little experience in Laravel and never build a full stack app using php.
The Laravel framework was relatively simple to wrap my head around, yet powerful enough to do what I had envisioned.
